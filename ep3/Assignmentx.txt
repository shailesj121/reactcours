what is JSX?
    JSX is a conventions where the html and javascript merges together, its a html like syntax, JSX Stands for "JavaScpriptXML"

Superpowers of JSX
    JSX makes Code More readable. JSX can Run javascript inside JSX code we need to use {javascript codes}.

Role of type attribute in script tag? What options can I use there?
    type attribute let our web browser know the is it a normal javascript or not, if not then we use module. 
    use can use "application/javascript" for noraml javascript
    or we can use "module" for javascript modules

    
so from now on we will not be using a createElement. because JSX is much more developer friendly.
 actuallly javascript only understand EcMAScript language whic meand it do not understand JSX or it is not Javascript.
basically what happen all the bundelers for react helps to do that. like parcel, it transpile(convert) the jsx code to understandable for javascripts before it reaches the JS engin


PARCEL itself not doing this conversion basicallly. have you heard that name before "babel". so babel is package that help to do that all this things
